# React + Vite

This is the Web Dev Jan-March class's react project. It is a calorie tracker app that allows users to log the food they eat every day. Users can add meals from an established database, add one-offs by manually entering a name and calorie count, or expand the database with meals they eat frequently for ease of use.
